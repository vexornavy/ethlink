  <p class="lead">Ethvault is a simple web ethereum wallet. Get started by creating a wallet or using your keyfile or private key to access your wallet.
    The most secure way to use Ethvault is to run the server on your own computer - visit the github page for more information.
    Ethvault can only send ethereum, so if you'd like to send tokens, please use an alternative wallet, such as <a href="https://myetherwallet.com/">MyEtherWallet</a></p>
